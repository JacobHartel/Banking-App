Final Project for C# 2 Fall 2024

This project was built in an MVC Architecture

It's fairly simple but it mostly just shows an understanding of the depth of .NET projects

I might tinker with it some more but I didn't put a lot of time into the styling. The API is setup
to work locally but can easily be changed, might add a startup ocndition. 

If you have any questions let me know.
